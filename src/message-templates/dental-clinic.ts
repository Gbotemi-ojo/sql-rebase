I’m Gbotemi, a website developer. I came across your clinic on Google and noticed you’re already showing up among the top results (that’s amazing 👏), but I also noticed there’s no website linked to your profile.

Having a website connected to your Google Profile and socials can help your clinic:
* Turn search visitors into actual patients
* Let people book appointments directly online
* Showcase your services, reviews, and team professionally
* Strengthen your credibility and make it easy for patients to contact you

You’re already doing great by being visible online.

I can help you take it further with a professional site that represents your clinic and attracts even more patients.

If this is something you have been looking forward to having, would you be open to a quick chat so I can share what that could look like?`;
